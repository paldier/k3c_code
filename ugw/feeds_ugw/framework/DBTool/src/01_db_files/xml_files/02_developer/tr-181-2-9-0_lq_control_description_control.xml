Each instance is associated with an interface capable of transporting Ethernet-encapsulated packets, and contains a set of unidirectional Ethernet statistics. The statistics are sampled either on ingress or on egress.  This is determined as follows: * If the instance is associated with an egress queue (or queues) via the {{param|Queue}} parameter or by setting {{param|AllQueues}} to {{true}} then data is sampled on egress.  In this case {{param|Bytes}} etc measure the data that has been sent on the interface, possibly filtered by {{param|Queue}} or {{param|VLANID}}. * Otherwise data is sampled on ingress.  In this case {{param|Bytes}} etc measure the data that has been received on the interface, possibly filtered by {{param|VLANID}}. When sampling on egress, the term ''received'' means ''received by the queuing sub-system''. Multiple instances can be associated with a single interface: individual instances can be configured to collect data associated with the entire interface, or with a particular VLAN and/or queue. The CPE MUST reset each instances's Stats parameters whenever the instance is disabled and re-enabled.  Whether this reset occurs when the instance becomes operationally disabled ({{param|Status}} = {{enum|Disabled|Status}}) or administratively enabled ({{param|Enable}} = {{true}}) is a local matter to the CPE.  This is similar to the behavior of interface statistics, e.g. as specified for {{object|Device.Ethernet.Interface.{i}.Stats}}.  Furthermore, this instance's Stats parameters MUST be reset whenever the referenced interface's Stats parameters are reset, or when the referenced queue or VLAN is disabled and re-enabled. For enabled table entries, if {{param|Interface}} references an interface that is not capable of transporting Ethernet-encapsulated packets, or if {{param|Queue}} references a queue that is not instantiated on {{param|Interface}}, or if {{param|Queue}} is not a valid reference and {{param|AllQueues}} is {{false}}, the table entry is inoperable and the CPE MUST set {{param|Status}} to {{enum|Error_Misconfigured|Status}}. Note: The {{object}} table includes unique key parameters that are strong references. If a strongly referenced object is deleted, the CPE will set the referencing parameter to {{empty}}.

The interface's IP addresses and prefixes are listed in the {{object|IPv4Address}}, {{object|IPv6Address}} and {{object|IPv6Prefix}} tables. Note that support for manipulating {{param|Loopback}} interfaces is OPTIONAL, so the implementation MAY choose not to create (or allow the ACS to create) {{object}} instances of type {{enum|Loopback|Type}}. When the ACS administratively disables the interface, i.e. sets {{param|Enable}} to {{false}}, the interface's automatically-assigned IP addresses and prefixes MAY be retained.  When the ACS administratively enables the interface, i.e. sets {{param|Enable}} to {{true}}, these IP addresses and prefixes MUST be refreshed.  It's up to the implementation to decide exactly what this means: it SHOULD take all reasonable steps to refresh everything but if it is unable, for example, to refresh a prefix that still has a significant lifetime, it might well choose to retain rather than discard it.

Any read-only parameters, e.g. {{param|Status}}, MUST return the same information as for the corresponding {{enum|Tunnel|Type}} interface.
