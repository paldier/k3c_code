config LTQ_PMCU_DEBUG
	bool
	prompt "Enable debug features"
	default n
	help 
	  This option enables debug prints and set -O0 for no optimization during
	  compilation for better debugging.

config LTQ_PMCU_DEBUG_TEMP
	bool
	prompt "Enable temperature sensor degugging"
	default y
	help 
	  This option enables the possibility to fake the temperature sensor
	  output value for easier and faster debugging. If this option is set
	  the temperature value will not taken from the hardware sensor anymore.
	  Instead the value can be defined and easily changed via sys-fs. This
	  can be used to quickly check the thermal SW control loop without
	  heating and cooling up and down the chip many times.
